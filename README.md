# Movies-Lists

This entire code is written in Java. The goal of this code is to explore the ADT list. Run the code from the main class.

Information about movies is stored in the class Movie. 
Note that IDs are unique but not titles and genres.


Note: This code is my solution for a programming assignement that was for a Data Structure course I had in college.
